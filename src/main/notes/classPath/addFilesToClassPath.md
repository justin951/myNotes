You can use the `javac` command with the `-cp` or `-classpath` option to specify the classpath when compiling your Java program from the command line.

To add the `Person.java` file to the classpath, you can use the following command:
```bash
javac -cp . Person.java
```
The dot (`.`) represents the current directory, which is where the `Person.java` file is located.

This command will compile the `Person.java` file and add it to the classpath. The existing files that are already tracked in the classpath will not be removed. The `-cp` option simply adds the specified directory (in this case, the current directory) to the classpath.

If you want to specify multiple directories or JAR files to include in the classpath, you can separate them with a colon (`:`) on Unix-like systems or a semicolon (`;`) on Windows. For example:
```bash
javac -cp .:path/to/other/dir:another/dir Person.java
```
Note that the order of the directories and JAR files in the classpath matters. The Java compiler will search for classes and resources in the order they appear in the classpath.

Alternatively, you can use the `java` command with the `-cp` option to run your Java program and specify the classpath at runtime. For example:
```bash
java -cp . Person
```
This will run the `Person` class with the classpath set to the current directory.

It's worth noting that if you're using a build tool like Maven or Gradle, you'll typically configure the classpath through the build tool's configuration files (e.g., `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`) rather than using the `javac` or `java` commands directly.
